# VX7 KHATA PRO

Offline customer ledger (credit / debit) manager for Windows. Python + PySide6 + SQLite.
Scope is the customer ledger only: no inventory, stock or billing/POS.

## Features

**Ledger core**
* Unlimited customers, each with a separate ledger; search by name or phone; per-customer and overall totals.
* Item-wise entries (item, quantity, rate, amount, notes). Quantity x Rate is calculated automatically.
* **Quick payment (Ctrl+J).** Only a payment? Pick the customer, type the amount, press Enter – no item needed. Available on the Dashboard, Customers, New Entry and Ledger pages.
* Entry types are shown as **Debit (Dr)** (customer took goods/money on credit, so the customer owes you) and **Credit (Cr)** (customer paid), the usual accounting convention for a customer's account. The words live in `vx7khata/labels.py` – edit them there to rename them everywhere (saved data is unaffected).
* Back-dated entries for any past date (date picker or DD-MM-YYYY). Running balances are always recomputed from the saved entries, so adding, editing or deleting an old entry can never leave a wrong balance.
* Ledger with date range, item search, opening / closing balance, edit and delete (with confirmation).
* PDF and Excel statements, registers and balance summaries (only the data you select is exported).
* Backup and restore with validation and an automatic safety copy.

**Added for business use**
* **Credit limit per customer.** Saving a Debit (Dr) entry, or editing an entry so that it takes a customer above their limit, asks for confirmation first. The Customers table, ledger and entry form show how much of the limit is used.
* **Due dates.** A Debit (Dr) entry can carry a promised payment date; overdue items are highlighted in the ledger.
* **Recovery page.** Aging report (0-30 / 31-60 / 61-90 / 90+ days) using FIFO (payments settle the oldest unpaid debit first; an advance offsets the next debit), overdue payments, and customers over their credit limit. Aging and overdue lists export to PDF and Excel.
* **Payment reminders.** Editable message template (English / Hinglish default). Copy it, or open it in WhatsApp (needs internet and WhatsApp on that PC; the app itself never sends anything).
* **Dashboard.** KPI cards, 12-month given-vs-received chart, top debtors and a "needs attention" panel.
* **Activity log.** Every customer / entry add, edit, delete and restore is recorded with before-and-after values. The app has no way to edit or remove these records. It is not tamper-proof: anyone with database tools can alter the file.
* **PIN lock** with a one-time recovery code, lock-out after repeated wrong PINs (the lock-out survives closing and reopening the app), and "Lock now" (Ctrl+L). This locks the app window; it does **not** encrypt the data file.
* **Automatic daily backup** (keeps the latest 14) to a folder you choose, plus manual backup.
* **Daily Entry page:** one block per customer (type, customer, date) with **as many product lines as you need** (product, quantity, rate, automatic total) and one large **Notes** box that scrolls/swipes when the text is long; add more customer blocks to enter many customers at once. The Notes of a block are stored with its first product. Rows added here do **not** go into the ledger straight away: they wait in a list below the grid and are saved into the customer's ledger **automatically 24 hours later** (checked every minute while the app is open, and at start-up for the time it was closed). Until then a row can be **deleted** (e.g. the customer brought the goods back; nothing reaches the ledger) or saved early with **Save now**. Waiting rows are not part of any balance, ledger, report or credit-limit balance until they are saved (the credit-limit warning does count them when you add a new row). The activity log records adding, deleting and saving them.
* **Print / PDF / Excel in one click:** select a customer on the Customers, New Entry or Ledger page and use the **Print**, **PDF** and **Excel** buttons for that customer's statement.
* **Light and dark themes**, business name and address printed on statements, keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+1..9 pages, Ctrl+N new entry, Ctrl+J quick payment, F5 refresh).

## Run from source

```
py -3 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Data is stored in `%APPDATA%\VX7 KHATA PRO\khata.db`. Set `VX7_DATA_DIR` to use another folder (e.g. a USB stick).

## Design decisions worth knowing

* **Money is integer paise.** No floating point anywhere in totals. Amounts accept at most 2 decimals; quantities at most 3.
* **Balances are never stored.** Every total and running balance is computed from the saved rows.
* **Two timestamps.** `txn_date` is the date the transaction happened (may be years ago). `created_at` is when the row was really entered and is never changed, not even by an edit (`updated_at` records edits).
* **Ordering.** Ledger order is transaction date, then entry order, so same-day entries are stable.
* **Item search keeps true balances.** When you search by item, the running balance column still shows the real account balance.
* **Dates.** Entered/shown as DD-MM-YYYY; future dates are rejected for transactions (due dates may be in the future); earliest year 1990.
* **Dashboard.** "Today's transactions" = entries dated today. "Historical transactions" = entries dated before today.
* **Negative balance** means the customer has paid in advance. Shown in green; a positive balance (customer owes you) in red.
* **Duplicate protection.** The Save button is disabled while saving, and the service rejects an identical entry (same customer, date, type, item, amount, notes) saved within 10 seconds; the UI then asks whether it is a genuine second entry.
* **Deleting.** Every entry delete needs confirmation. A customer that has entries cannot be deleted.
* **Backup.** Uses SQLite's online-backup API, then re-opens and checks the copy. **Restore** validates the file (SQLite header, integrity check, schema, foreign keys, entry sanity, not from a newer app version), writes a safety copy to `safety_backups\`, then swaps the file in. Settings (including the PIN and theme) come from the restored backup. Older-schema backups are upgraded on restore.

## Tests

```
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pytest -q tests          # or: python -m unittest discover -s tests -t .
```

`tests/test_acceptance.py` maps one-to-one to acceptance tests A-F (E is also run across two separate Python processes).
`tests/test_daily_pending.py` covers the 24-hour Daily Entry rows (add, delete, auto-save, save now, backup/restore, upgrade).
`tests/test_premium.py`, `test_export_premium.py`, `test_viewmodel.py` cover credit limits, due dates, aging, reminders, PIN, audit log, auto-backup and the new exports.
`tests/test_ui_smoke.py` drives the real Qt window headlessly (14 scenarios); it is skipped automatically if PySide6 is not installed.

## Build the Windows executable and installer

Requirements: Windows 10/11 (64-bit), Python 3.10+ from python.org, and optionally [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) for the installer.

```
packaging\build_windows.bat
```

It creates a venv, installs dependencies, **runs the tests (and stops if they fail)**, deletes old `build`/`dist` folders, builds `dist\VX7 KHATA PRO\VX7 KHATA PRO.exe` with PyInstaller, and builds `dist\installer\VX7_KHATA_PRO_Setup_1.0.0.exe` if Inno Setup is installed.

Manual steps if you prefer:

```
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pyinstaller packaging\vx7_khata_pro.spec --noconfirm --clean
ISCC packaging\installer.iss
```

`.github/workflows/windows-build.yml` does the same on GitHub Actions (`windows-latest`) and uploads the exe and installer as artifacts.

Notes: the installer is unsigned, so Windows SmartScreen may warn on first run. Uninstalling does not delete your data in `%APPDATA%\VX7 KHATA PRO`.

## Known limitations

* **PDF text rendering** uses the bundled DejaVu Sans font. English text and the rupee sign are fine. ReportLab does not do complex-script shaping, so Hindi (Devanagari) item names will not shape correctly in PDFs. They are stored, shown in the app and exported to Excel correctly.
* One customer name must be unique (case-insensitive). Add a locality to tell two people apart ("Rahul (Market Road)").
* Single user, single machine. Two people editing one data file over a network share is not supported.
* The PIN is a screen lock, not encryption (see above).

## New in v10
* **Daily Entry -> "+ New customer".** Adds a customer without leaving the page and selects it in the row you are on.
  Typing a name that does not exist and pressing "Add entries" also offers to create that customer.
* **Receipt.** Ledger page -> "Receipt" (and the optional tick box in Quick payment) now prints through the normal Windows print flow like every other report. See 1.2.0 below.

## Fixes after the v8 bug check
* Recovery / aging / overdue reports "as on" a past date now ignore entries and payments dated after that day.
* PDF exports can show Hindi / Gujarati text: add Noto Sans font files to `vx7khata/assets/fonts` (see `ADD-FONTS.txt` there).
* Automatic-backup pruning keeps the newest file even when two backups are made in the same second, and only removes files the app named itself.
* The delete-entry confirmation shows Debit (Dr) / Credit (Cr) instead of UDHAAR / JAMA.

## What's new in 1.1.0

* **Glass look** - soft gradient background, frosted semi-transparent panels with a bright edge, glassy sidebar, gradient buttons (light and dark). Qt style sheets cannot blur, so the effect is built from translucency and gradients; colours live in `vx7khata/ui/theme.py`.
* **Print setup** - before printing a ledger: every paper size, a custom width x height, Portrait / Landscape, and a tick list of what to print (columns, shop details, contact, totals box, "Printed on"). Balance is off by default. Preview toolbar has a "Page setup..." button.
* **Bug fixes** - a mistyped / future date is flagged red and rejected instead of silently reverting; date boxes follow midnight; customer search no longer matches phone numbers when you type a name containing digits; a waiting Daily Entry row can no longer be saved twice; amounts like `1,2,3` are rejected; chart labels never show `100K`; naive/aware timestamps cannot crash the duplicate check.

## Backup, export and import (1.1.0)

* **Automatic backup every 24 hours** - made as soon as the newest automatic backup is 24 hours old (checked every minute while the app is open, and at start-up / close). It no longer waits for the next calendar day. The latest 14 are kept; Settings shows when the last one was made. If the folder cannot be used the app shows a message in the status bar and retries after an hour.
* **Export database** (Settings > Data and backups) - saves ONE `.db` file with all customers, entries, waiting Daily Entry rows, activity log and settings. The file is checked after saving.
* **Import database** - loads such a `.db` file (on this or another PC). A safety copy of the current data is saved first, an older file is upgraded automatically, and nothing is changed if the file is damaged.

## What's new in 1.2.0

* **Daily Udhaar-Jama Summary** (sidebar, second item). Pick any date (default = today on this PC, follows midnight). Live cards: Total Jama, Total Udhaar, Net daily difference (Jama minus Udhaar - labelled as *not* the cash balance), Total transactions, Customers. Table of every entry with customer, type, amount, date and time; filter Udhaar / Jama, search by customer name, sort by name / amount / time, double-click or "Open customer ledger" to jump to the ledger. Print (standard print dialog), PDF and Excel. All figures are re-read from the saved entries every time, so add / edit / delete is reflected at once and no entry is counted twice. "Dated on this day" counts entries by their transaction date; "Entered on this day" counts entries typed in that day, including back-dated ones (uses the never-edited `created_at` time).
* **Backups** (`vx7khata/autobackup.py`): every backup is a NEW file `SJB_KHATA_BACKUP_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.db` in `Downloads\SJB KHATA BACKUP 24` (the real Windows Downloads folder, created automatically; can be changed in Settings). SQLite online-backup from a read-only connection, then the copy is re-opened and integrity-checked. Old backups are never deleted. State (enabled, last success, status, failures) is kept in `backup_state.json` / `backup_history.jsonl` next to the database. Automatic: while the app is open (checked every minute), at start-up (overdue backup), and **when the app is closed through a per-user Windows Task Scheduler task** (`VX7 KHATA PRO Automatic Backup`, runs `VX7 KHATA PRO.exe --backup` daily, catches up after the PC was off). The app creates the task when automatic backup is on and removes it when you switch it off. If Task Scheduler is refused, the overdue backup is made at the next start instead.
* **Settings > Backup & Recovery:** Enable/Disable automatic backup, frequency (24 hours), Backup Now, Open Backup Folder, Last successful backup, Next scheduled backup, folder path (change / back to default), status (Success / In Progress / Failed + last error), View Backup History, Restore from Backup (validates, asks to confirm, writes a safety copy first), Export database.
* **Printing:** receipts no longer use a fixed 2-inch roll page. Every print (ledger statement, receipt, Daily Summary) goes through page setup (A4, A5, other sizes, custom width x height in mm, portrait / landscape) and then the Qt print preview with the printer chooser, page range, margins and scaling. Receipt and ledger data are untouched.
* No database schema change; existing customers, entries and balances are not modified.
